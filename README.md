# TrafficSensAI: Predictive Traffic Accident Analysis Tool 🚦


TrafficSensAI is a machine-learning framework for analyzing and predicting traffic collision hotspots. Leveraging datasets from multiple cities in the U.S., this project identifies high-risk traffic zones and contributes to accident prevention and optimized traffic management.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Hotspot Identification:** Uses DBSCAN clustering to detect accident-prone areas.
- **Severity Prediction:** Employs a Random Forest model to predict accident severity based on temporal, environmental, and infrastructure features.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Unveils insights into accident trends using spatial and temporal visualizations.
- **Granular Risk Ratings:** Classifies accident-prone areas on a risk scale (1-4) for targeted interventions.

## 📊 Data Sources
1. [U.S. Accidents Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
2. [SWITRS California Highway Patrol Data](https://opendata.sandag.org/Transportation/Safety-Collisions-SWITRS-2023/7mrt-w2uu/data)

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Filtered California-specific data.
   - Handled missing values and normalized variables.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extracted temporal and environmental features (e.g., `Time_of_Day`, `Weather_Condition`).
   - Encoded categorical variables for machine learning models.
3. **Clustering (DBSCAN):**
   - Identified accident hotspots using spatial data.
   - Rated clusters by accident density and severity.
4. **Random Forest Model:**
   - Predicted accident severity.
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal accuracy.
